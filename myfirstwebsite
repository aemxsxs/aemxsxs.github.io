    Hey Hey Hey, my name is Eugene Moses III!

    I was born and raised in Kansas City, Missouri. I'm currently a senior studying Communication with an emphasis in Mass Media. I don't have any previous web app development experience at all.with this course I expect to leave with a basic understanding of HTML and the bailey to understand how websites are built out better. I personally like design so knowing how websites are built and the capabilities of one will help me when designing things if i am not on the development team. As I will have a very brief understanding of the entire  capabilities . I love to consume media but specifically long from. Long form is anything typically over 1000 words or over 10 minutes in length. Television shows, Movies or even hour long YouTube videos are where most of my screen time is spent.
