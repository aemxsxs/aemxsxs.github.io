        <p>Welcome to my virtual portfolio, a curated collection showcasing some of the creations that have emerged from my four years in college. While the quantity may not be vast, each piece holds significant meaning for me. This website serves as a peek into the inner workings of my mind—an "inside out" moment where I unravel the thought processes that birthed these artworks.
        <br>
        <br>
        Embark on this journey, and by the end, my hope is that you not only comprehend the rationale behind each piece but also gain insights into how I deconstruct and approach my creative endeavors. Understanding that the genesis of a piece extends beyond the physical act of putting pencil to paper or brush to canvas, I invite you to explore the stories behind my creations. Let this portfolio be a window into the considerations, reflections, and nuances that shape my artistic endeavors. As you peruse these pages, may you find inspiration to apply similar practices when engaging with other pieces of art.
