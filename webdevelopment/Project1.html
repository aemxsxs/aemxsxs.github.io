    Full story on full solo project page
    Discover the story behind this captivating piece, which originated as an unexpected acquisition during a late-night IHOP adventure in my freshman year. This stolen painting, salvaged before its destiny was altered, serves as a tangible memory of a spontaneous moment when inspiration struck. It wasn't until a  Zoom orientation for my internship during a random summer that I had an epiphany—I had forgotten how to paint. Three years had elapsed without any artistic endeavors, an unusual hiatus for someone like me.
    
    Recognizing this creative block was the first step in reclaiming my artistic identity. The process, facilitated by the quick-drying nature of the medium, took a mere two hours. Unplanned and spontaneous, the layers converged seamlessly, culminating in a final signature—something I hadn't done in what felt like an eternity.
    
    Since this transformative experience, I have not forgotten the joy of painting. The subsequent projects that followed this painting are a testament to the rekindled passion and the commitment to never let environmental factors stifle my true nature again. Explore the journey that began with this stolen painting, leading to a renewed dedication to artistic expression and authenticity.
