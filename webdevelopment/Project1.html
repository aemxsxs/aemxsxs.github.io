    Discover the story behind this captivating piece, which originated as an unexpected acquisition during a late-night IHOP adventure in my freshman year. This stolen painting, salvaged before its destiny was altered, serves as a tangible memory of a spontaneous moment when inspiration struck. It wasn't until a  Zoom orientation for my internship during a random summer that I had an epiphany—I had forgotten how to paint. Three years had elapsed without any artistic endeavors, an unusual hiatus for someone like me.
    <br>
    Recognizing this creative block was the first step in reclaiming my artistic identity. The process, facilitated by the quick-drying nature of the medium, took a mere two hours. Unplanned and spontaneous, the layers converged seamlessly, culminating in a final signature—something I hadn't done in what felt like an eternity.
    <br>
    Since this transformative experience, I have not forgotten the joy of painting. The subsequent projects that followed this painting are a testament to the rekindled passion and the commitment to never let environmental factors stifle my true nature again. Explore the journey that began with this stolen painting, leading to a renewed dedication to artistic expression and authenticity.
