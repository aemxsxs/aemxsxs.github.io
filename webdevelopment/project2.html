    Once I regained all inspiration and my creative flow back, I ventured into the realm of filmmaking. As part of the curriculum, our final project involved creating a short film, requiring us to develop an original script, coordinate actors, capture dialogue, and handle the editing process. This immersive experience not only exposed me to the foundational elements of crafting a compelling film but also taught me how to convey a message effectively without relying on sound.

    The resulting short film revolves around a boy embarking on a first date with a disinterested girl. Their struggles with communication and uncertainty about how to spend their time together unfold throughout the narrative. As the date progresses, the boy comes to the realization that he may be pursuing the wrong connection, while simultaneously, the girl has already formed her opinion about whether she would consider another date with him.

    In the short film, the boy symbolically represents the journey of exploring academic majors, embodying the notion of being on the wrong path. His struggles during the first date mirror the challenges faced when pursuing a major that doesn't align with one's true passion. The girl, reflecting my own experiences, embodies the uncertainty and search for the right fit amidst varied academic pursuits. As the boy realizes he might be barking up the wrong tree, it parallels the moment of self-discovery when I recognized the need for a change in direction. The film becomes a metaphor for the continuous exploration, the trial and error of finding the right major, and the eventual clarity that comes when the right path is chosen. It reflects the universal theme of navigating through uncertainties and embracing the journey towards discovering one's true calling.
