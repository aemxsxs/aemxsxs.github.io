        <h3>About Me</h3>
    

    
        <p>
            I was born and raised in Kansas City, Missouri. I'm currently a senior studying Communication with an emphasis in Mass Media.
            I don't have any previous web app development experience at all. 
            With this course I expect to leave with a basic understanding of HTML and the ability to understand how websites are built out better.
            I personally like design so knowing how websites are built and the capabilities of one will help me when designing things if I am not on the development team. 
            As I will have a very brief understanding of the entire  capabilities. 
            <br>
            I love to consume media, but specifically long from. Long form is anything typically over 1000 words or over 10 minutes in length. 
            <em>Televison shows, and movies</em>or even hour long YouTube videos are where most of my screen time is spent. Currently I am watching Desperate Housewives. It is a show from 2004. 
            <em>What I believe to be the peak of American Televison.</em>
