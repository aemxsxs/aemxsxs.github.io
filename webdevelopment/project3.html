    This photo series was a Halloween project that I embarked on this past October. With a desire to infuse a sense of fun into my Halloween experience, I chose characters that would not only be enjoyable to embody but also lend themselves to creative and contextually relevant posts. Rather than merely showcasing me porteying Willy Wonka's unconventional setting, I aimed to integrate myself seamlessly into images from the movie and promotional materials.
    <br>
    <br>
    Extensive hours were dedicated to scouring Pinterest and Google for suitable scenes from the movie that I could recreate. Having previously undertaken a similar project for another Halloween character (Edna Mode), I had a clear idea of the desired elements: images with distinct outlines that facilitated easy pose recreation and subsequent Photoshop integration.
    <br>
    <br>
    On Halloween day, armed with these selected images in my camera roll and a clear vision, I orchestrated a photoshoot with a friend before the festivities began. Each pose was meticulously recreated, ensuring accuracy in both posture and angle for seamless self-cutouts during post-editing. Attention was given to backgrounds with sufficient contrast to simplify the editing process, while consistent lighting was maintained to ensure a natural blend with the original images.
